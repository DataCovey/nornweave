**Open-source, self-hosted Inbox-as-a-Service API for AI Agents.**

Standard email APIs are stateless and built for transactional sending. NornWeave adds a **stateful layer** (Inboxes, Threads, History) and an **intelligent layer** (Markdown parsing, Semantic Search) to make email consumable by LLMs via REST or MCP.

In Norse mythology, the Norns (Urdr, Verdandi, and Skuld) dwell at the base of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. They weave the tapestry of fate for all beings. Similarly, NornWeave:

- Takes raw "water" (incoming email data streams)
- Weaves disconnected messages into coherent **Threads** (the Tapestry)
- Nourishes AI Agents with clean, structured context
