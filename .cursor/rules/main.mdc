# NornWeave - Cursor Rules

NornWeave is an open-source, self-hosted Inbox-as-a-Service API for AI Agents. It provides a stateful email layer (Inboxes, Threads, History) and an intelligent layer (Markdown parsing, Semantic Search) for LLMs via REST or MCP.

## Architecture Overview

NornWeave uses a thematic architecture inspired by Norse mythology:

| Module | Name | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `urdr` | The Well | Storage layer - PostgreSQL/SQLite adapters, Alembic migrations |
| `verdandi` | The Loom | Ingestion - webhook + IMAP, HTML→Markdown, threading, LLM thread summarization |
| `skuld` | The Prophecy | Outbound - rate limiting, scheduling, email sending |
| `yggdrasil` | World Tree | FastAPI gateway - routes, middleware, API endpoints |
| `huginn` | Thought Raven | MCP Resources - read operations for AI agents |
| `muninn` | Memory Raven | MCP Tools - write operations for AI agents |

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: 3.14+ with full type hints
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI with async/await
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2 with `pydantic-settings`
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) with PostgreSQL (asyncpg) or SQLite (aiosqlite)
- **Migrations**: Alembic
- **AI Integration**: MCP SDK for Claude/Cursor integration
- **HTTP Client**: httpx (async)
- **Package Manager**: uv
- **Linting/Formatting**: Ruff
- **Type Checking**: MyPy (strict mode)
- **Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- **Documentation**: Hugo static site

## Development Guidelines

### General Principles
- **Type safety**: All functions must have complete type hints
- **Async-first**: Use async/await for all I/O operations
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public functions and classes
- **Testing**: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- **Security**: Never hardcode credentials; use environment variables

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 (enforced by Ruff)
- Line length: 100 characters
- Use double quotes for strings
- Use `pathlib.Path` over `os.path`
- Use comprehensions where they improve readability
- Prefer `httpx` for HTTP requests (async support)

### FastAPI Best Practices
- Use dependency injection via `Depends()`
- Define request/response models with Pydantic
- Use `HTTPException` for error responses with appropriate status codes
- Group routes in routers, version API endpoints (e.g., `/v1/`)
- Add OpenAPI documentation to endpoints

### Database Guidelines
- Use SQLAlchemy async sessions
- Define models in `src/nornweave/models/`
- Create Alembic migrations for all schema changes in `src/nornweave/urdr/migrations/`
- Use repository pattern for data access in `urdr/adapters/`
- Support both PostgreSQL (production) and SQLite (development/testing)

### MCP Integration
- Resources (read-only data) go in `huginn/`
- Tools (actions) go in `muninn/`
- Follow MCP SDK patterns for tool definitions
- Include clear descriptions for AI agent consumption

### Testing
- Place unit tests in `tests/unit/` mirroring source structure
- Place integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests
- Use fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`
- Test files in `tests/fixtures/` (never commit real user data)

### Documentation Website (web/)
- Use Hugo for static site generation
- Content in Markdown at `web/content/docs/`
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Keep API documentation in sync with code changes

### Keeping documentation in sync
When adding, changing, or removing **features** (e.g. providers, capabilities, architecture), update these so they stay accurate:
- **README.md**: Sections "Features", "Architecture", "Supported Providers", "Repository Structure", and "MCP Integration" (tools table) as relevant.
- **web/content/docs/**: Guides, API docs, and concept pages that describe the feature.
- **.cursor/rules/main.mdc**: "Repository Structure" and "Architecture Overview" (and this list if doc locations change).
Prefer a single commit that includes both the code change and the doc/rule updates.

## File Organization

- Module names: snake_case
- Class names: PascalCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Pydantic models: `*Schema` for API, `*Model` for DB
- Each module should have an `__init__.py` exposing public API

## Git Workflow

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers when applicable (e.g., `feat: add mailgun webhook (#42)`)
- Run `make lint` and `make test` before committing

## OpenSpec Workflow

This repository uses **OpenSpec** for structured feature development and change management. OpenSpec artifacts provide detailed specifications, design decisions, and implementation context.

### Directory Structure
- `openspec/specs/` - Active feature specifications and design documents
- `openspec/changes/archive/` - Completed changes for historical reference

### When to Use OpenSpec
- **Before implementing**: Check `openspec/specs/` for existing specifications related to your task
- **For context**: Specs contain rationale, API designs, data models, and implementation details
- **As reference**: Archived changes show how similar features were implemented

### Spec Contents
Each spec typically includes:
- Problem statement and goals
- API design and data models
- Implementation approach and technical decisions
- Edge cases and error handling
- Testing strategy

## Common Commands

```bash
make install-dev    # Install dependencies with dev extras
make dev            # Run development server
make test           # Run test suite
make lint           # Run Ruff linter
make format         # Format code with Ruff
make migrate        # Run database migrations
make typecheck      # Run MyPy type checker
```

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When working in this codebase:
1. **Module awareness**: Understand the Norse mythology naming and purpose of each module
2. **Async patterns**: All database and HTTP operations must be async
3. **Type hints**: Always include complete type annotations
4. **Provider abstraction**: Email providers are abstracted in `adapters/` - maintain this pattern
5. **MCP compatibility**: When adding features, consider MCP tool/resource exposure for AI agents
6. **OpenSpec context**: Check `openspec/specs/` for detailed specifications before implementing features - specs contain design decisions, API contracts, and implementation guidance
7. **Doc sync**: When implementing or changing user-facing features, update README.md, relevant `web/content/docs/` pages, and `.cursor/rules/main.mdc` (Repository Structure / Architecture) so they stay accurate
8. **.env file**: Use `.env.example` as a template for `.env` file and keep it up to date with the latest environment variables.
