Hi Alice,

Thanks for the design doc. I have a few comments:

1. The threading algorithm looks solid. I agree with the In-Reply-To
   fallback to References approach.
2. For the IMAP polling, consider adding exponential backoff on
   connection failures.
3. The attachment storage abstraction is clean - easy to swap backends.

I'll approve once items 1-2 are addressed in the next revision.

Cheers,
Eve
